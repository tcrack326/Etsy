"description": "******************Welcome to Cherry Red Toppers! ******************\r\n\r\nHow much cuter can you get than this?! This sweet puppy just wanted to be Santa&#39;s little helper, but those lights can be so darn tricky! (Life is hard without opposable thumbs.)\r\n\r\nYou can purchase the husky you see in the photos, or you can have an ornament made to look like your pet. Just send me a few photos and purchase this listing, and I can have a custom ornament made for you in 2-3 days.\r\n\r\nThe ornament will include your pet, the strand of lights, and you can include a name tag on the ribbon as well if you give me the name of your pet.\r\n\r\nAll of my ornaments are hand-sculpted from artist-quality polymer clays and are made to last. They can be wiped clean with a wet rag if they ever get dusty or dirty, and they are quite a bit tougher than you might think! (Much safer than glass ornaments around your furry friends.)\r\n\r\nAll ornaments come carefully packaged and wrapped for delivery.\r\n\r\nThis sweet guy (or gal) is ready to ship, and will be shipped within 3 business days after you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nNot quite the dog you were looking for? Let me know and I will create a custom ornament just for you at no additional charge.",

All toppers are hand sculpted from artist-quality polymer clay to provide you with the heirloom-quality pieces that you are looking for on your special day.  If you have an idea or suggestion on how I can better serve you and our brides, please let us know!",
"policy_payment": "We accept payment through Paypal or Direct Checkout through Etsy. This allows us to get your topper delivered to you as quickly as possible without having to wait for checks to mail and post.  You are still able to pay with a check through PayPal, so you don&#39;t even have to use a credit card!  If you have any questions about PayPal or payment, simply convo me and hopefully I can help!",
"policy_shipping": "Currently, our toppers are able to ship within 8 weeks of ordering! Yay! However, that is not always the case so if you need your topper quickly, let me know and I can prioritize your order accordingly.  I prefer clients to order at least 2 months prior to their event, but I understand that this is not always possible, so feel free to contact me and see how quickly I can get something to your doorstep. Rush shipping can always be arranged.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nOur toppers are shipped anywhere you need them to go! For domestic orders I ship via USPS priority mail, and for international orders I will find the carrier that can get your topper to you in the least time and for the least amount of money.  This helps keep the shipping costs for you as low as I can get them.  However, if you need something shipped faster, I can always arrange overnight or express delivery.  Simply let me know and I can set it up for you.\r\n\r\nOnce your topper has shipped, I will send you a shipping notification and a tracking number to let you know your topper is on its way. \r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for packages that are damaged or lost during shipping.   We do offer insurance for all packages, so just let me know that you would like to purchase insurance and I can arrange it for you.  Insurance costs $2, and is recommended for all packages.  (Always better safe than sorry)\r\n\r\nWe make it our highest priority to properly package and protect your topper during shipping, so we do all we can to ensure that your topper arrives safely.  Unfortunately, on occasion an item might be damaged slightly(e.g. a flower falls out of the bouquet), but can almost always be repaired with a simple dot of good-ol-fashioned super glue.  \r\n\r\nIf further repairs are needed, simply contact me and we can work something out!",

"policy_additional": "This is the standard customization form I have all of my brides fill out when ordering a bride and groom topper.  It helps me get all of the information I need and outlines everything for you, the customer, so that we can both know exactly what to expect. Photos are also appreciated.  Additional pricing information can also be found here. \r\n\r\n\r\nBefore purchasing a listing, always contact me first just to make sure that I am still accepting orders for that date.  My schedule varies depending on the time of year, so sometimes I will need up to three months&#39; notice to guarantee that I will have enough time to devote to your topper.  All orders for May and June are currently being taken as rush orders to meet the demand. \r\n\r\nWedding date:\r\n\r\n*For the Bride*\r\n-Name-\r\n-skin tone-\r\n-hair color, length, and style-\r\n-eye color-\r\n-bouquet description-\r\n-dress description – (please send photo or link)-\r\n-any glasses, tattoos, etc.-\r\n\r\n*For the Groom*\r\n-Name-\r\n-skin tone-\r\n-hair color, length, and style-\r\n-eye color-\r\n-suit color-\r\n-shirt color-\r\n-tie color-\r\n-any glasses, facial hair, tattoos, etc.-\r\n\r\n*Pets or other items to include*\r\n-\r\n-\r\n-\r\n\r\nAdditional items:\r\n\r\n• cat or dog - $20\r\n• children - $35\r\n• hat or helmet - $10\r\n• bike - $35\r\n• musical instrument - $20\r\n• stack of books - $10\r\n• flag or pennant - $10\r\n• banner - $20\r\n• team jersey or shirt with logo - $15\r\n• (I do not offer cars, trucks, or 4-wheelers at this time)\r\n• Other items will be priced on a case by case basis\r\n• US shipping: $10\r\n• International shipping: $18\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are any extra customizations that you want, simply let me know and I will create a custom listing for you with the appropriate price.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!

The camera does not accurately depict the deep violet color, and cannot convey how thick and soft this fur is!\r\n\r\nThe 100% cotton lining features what at first glance appears to be a never-ending squiggled line in spirals and swoops, but on closer inspection shows itself to be a swarm of tiny bats on a purple background!  \r\nThe oversized ears have been tucked and stitched so they stand up and show their lining.\r\n\r\nThis hat is ONE OF A KIND!\r\n\r\nThis hat fits most adults.\r\nHand washing in cool water/drip dry recommended, as we cannot guarantee the washability of faux fur.\r\n\r\nThis hat will be shipped in a large envelope via standard USPS.\r\nPlease contact us if you interested in international shipping.",

"description": "This Aviator-style hat is made from soft, EXTRA thick, high quality faux fur in deep purple with black tips. The camera does not accurately depict the deep violet color, and cannot convey how thick and soft this fur is!\r\n\r\nThe 100% cotton lining features some adorable Japanese &quot;Lucky Cats&quot; and other familiar Japanese designs in teal, purple, white, and shiny gold (with touches of maroon) on a black background! Designs have been &quot;fussy cut&quot; to feature a different &quot;Lucky Cat&quot; inside each ear. \r\nThe oversized ears have been tucked and stitched so they stand up and show their lining.\r\n\r\nThis hat is ONE OF A KIND!\r\n\r\nThis hat fits most adults.\r\nHand washing in cool water/drip dry recommended, as we cannot guarantee the washability of faux fur.\r\n\r\nThis hat will be shipped in a large envelope via standard USPS.\r\nPlease contact us if you interested in international shipping.",

"policy_welcome": "Thank you so much for finding me here on Etsy!\r\n\r\nMy shop website is: www.HeatherGallerArt.etsy.com\r\n\r\nCome friend me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/CollectArtwork\r\n\r\nABOUT ME:\r\n\r\n\t\r\nby Jim Memmott of Rochester Magazine\r\n\r\nHeather Galler must love dogs.  And cats, and birds and Rochester, too - but let&#39;s focus on dogs for now.\r\n\r\nFor starters, there are the two Labradoodles (Buddha and Bacon) and the one mixed breed, Ghandi, that share a home in Perinton with Galler, her husband, Michael, and their son Nathan.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are Galler&#39;s dog portraits.\r\nPainted in a colorful, folk art style, they have captured the imagination of dog lovers throughout the United States and beyond.  Galler&#39;s art has sold in all 50 states and 34 countries.  And her business keeps growing.\r\n\r\n&quot;Every day I pinch myself&quot; she says.  &quot;I&#39;m constantly commissioned for paintings.  I&#39;m usually working on three at a time.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe&#39;s selling prints, too, online and in stores.  Beyond that, she has licensed her art for sale on T-shirts, greeting cards, necklaces and other items.\r\n\r\nAnd all of it is easily recognized, for a pet portrait by Galler is like no other pet portrait you&#39;ve seen.  A case in point, her miniature Schnauzer: formed from colors and geometric shapes, pink triangle ears with white dots, a black - white diamond leg, a purple bandit mask - it&#39;s a Schnauzer as seen through a kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nIn yet, it&#39;s still very much that best friend you know and love, with the tilt of it&#39;s head, the love - me look in it&#39;s eyes.  All ever- so schnauzer. \r\n\r\n&quot;I want the dog to be recognizable, but I want to glorify the animal,&quot; Galler says.\r\n\r\nShe is speaking from her home/studio just a stones throw from the house she grew up in after moving to Rochester when she was 5.\r\n\r\nNow 42, Galler places the beginning of her art career to the time she was Heather Glasgow and a Junior at the Harley School.  &quot;I ran for Student President and lost in a close race,&quot;  she says.  &quot;I went home and was crying, devastated.  I started created art on the backs of my campaign posters.  I never had any interest in art, but I created these collages.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe took the collages to her art teacher, Kelly Fallon, who liked what she saw.  Encouraged by Fallon, Galler started doing more art, and she really hasn&#39;t stopped since.\r\n\r\nNot that she was an over night sensation.  After High School, Galler enrolled in The Cleveland Institute of Art but didn&#39;t last long.  &quot;I didn&#39;t want anyone to teach me,&quot; she says.  &quot;I wanted my own point of view.  But I didn&#39;t have a point of view.&quot;  \r\n\r\nShe dropped out and went backpacking for a year in Europe, earning money by working in a pub and as a Nanny.   When she came home, her parents said that enough was enough and she should go into the Military.  Which she did, serving 4 years in the US Navy.  She returned to Rochester after, working various jobs while in painting in a Art Studio in the Village Gate.  (A mural she painted in 1996 is still there today)\r\n\r\n&quot;I was getting of a sense of my voice,&quot; Galler says.  &quot;I was getting closer, but I wasn&#39;t quite there.&quot; \r\n\r\nA position in sales took her to Atlanta, and in 2001 she started a Website Development company that took off.  Michael joined the company in 2003 and in 2005, she and Michael married.  A year later, Nathan was born.\r\n\r\nAbout then, Galler increasingly nostalgic for Rochester, NY.  In 2007 she and her family, then living in Florida, came back to the Forest Hills neighborhood where she grew up.\r\n\r\n&quot;I wanted Nathan to go to Powers Farm Market at Thanksgiving,&quot; She says.  &quot;I wanted him to walk down Park Ave and go to lunch at Jines.&quot;\r\n\r\nThen the recession hit, and Galler had to shut her company down.  All the while she found herself doing more and more art, experimenting with the same style she had used on cityscapes for paintings of animals - not just dogs, but cats and birds, too.  She also has a series of paintings devoted to the Mexican Artist Frida Kahlo.\r\n\r\nSince in 2008, Galler has painting Full-time.  Michael, who is also an artist, is handling the business side of the art.\r\n\r\nGaller takes joy in her work and in the fact that art teachers around the Country are having their students turn to her work for inspiration.  \r\n\r\n&quot;This is probably the most rewarding thing that has happened to me, seeing kids, my son&#39;s age, inspired by me,&quot;  Galler says.\r\n\r\nAs busy as she is, Galler finds time to wander in Rochester, to visit the places that drew her back home.  All in all, she&#39;s happy, which she says may be the key to her work.  And she remains grateful for not having won that Harley election.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thank God that happened,&quot; She says.  &quot;That was a really a lesson in life.  Things for a reason, though you don&#39;t always know what the reason is.&quot;",

There also may be a rush order fee charge.***\r\n\r\nWe live in New Hampshire so there is no sales tax on our items.",
"policy_shipping": "***Please check your ship to address and make sure it is correct! We ship to the address on your account unless you specify otherwise. If we have to reship an item that was undelivered because of an incorrect address you will have to pay the new shipping charges to resend it.***\r\n\r\nMost ready to ship and vintage items will be mailed out within 1-3 business days of cleared payment unless purchased with a made to order item. All items would then be shipped when the made to order item(s) are completed. For made to order items, our current production time is listed in our shop announcement and under processing time in each listing. For custom or large orders, we will give you a time estimate. \r\nAn e-check may prolong the time until an item is shipped as we will not ship until funds have cleared. If you have a new Paypal account, it may take 24 hours or more for Paypal to verify your account and process payment. We will send you an email with the tracking when your item is shipped.\r\n\r\n***For Buyers Within The U.S.***\r\n\r\nWe ship using USPS Priority mail  (2-3 business days), USPS First Class Mail (2-5 business days) or Parcel Post (2-9 business days) and occasionally through Fedex Ground (3 to 4 business days). We use delivery confirmation (included in the shipping charges) so we will be able to give you a tracking number to track your item. \r\n\r\n ***For International Buyers***\r\n\r\nFor buyers outside the United States, most items are shipped via First Class International mail (usually 7-14 business days). If it is a large item or order and the box weighs over 4 pounds it has to be sent through Priority International mail (usually 6-10 business days). It may be difficult for us to give you an exact time of arrival for your package, as it depends also on customs and the mail service in your specific country. Any customs taxes or fees are the buyer&#39;s responsibility. \r\nFor buyers in Canada, we can provide you with a tracking number when your item(s) are shipped. For all other international buyers, we will provide you with the custom&#39;s number when we have shipped your item. However, once your package leaves the U.S., we can no longer track it through the USPS.\r\n\r\n",

If we cannot offer you a solution then the item(s) may be returned to us (with the exception of custom items, see below for more details) and we will refund the purchase price of the item, if it is returned to us within 2 weeks of the date you received it and in it&#39;s original, unused condition that we sent it in. We will not refund the initial shipping costs or return shipping. Returned items must be mailed with tracking.\r\n\r\n***Custom orders with such things as custom mixed colors, custom / odd sizes, names, monograms, multiple initials, dates and other personalized / customized details, cannot be returned.*** \r\n\r\n",

We receive orders on a daily basis and that can effect our production time. Please also note, if you purchase a listing at a later date, the completion date may be later, as the production time begins from the time payment is made and cleared.\r\n\r\n- Please contact us through Etsy convo. This is the best way to reach us regarding your order.\r\n\r\n- Vintage Items:  We try to represent our vintage items the best we can through listing photos and descriptions.

It measures approximately 8&quot; in circumference and 2.25&quot; in diameter. It will comfortably fit a small to average size wrist in the style of a bangle. I wear these every day and love them! They are very durable and fun, and since there is no clasp they are easy to put on and take off.",

Both adult and child sizes are available.\r\n\r\n***This mask is made to order and ships within 3-5 business days of your purchase. Because it is made to order, variations in paint pattern and coloration my vary slightly; each one is uniquely made for you! I ship via USPS Priority Mail 2-Day shipping, which should ship to anywhere in the US within 2-3 business days. I will send you the tracking number after your package has shipped.\r\n\r\nAll of my masks are cut and molded by hand from leather, carefully painted with acrylics, and sealed with matte leather sealer and a gloss varnish for protection. The back of the mask is signed and dated. You have the option of either a satin ribbon or elastic cord, which can fastened behind the ears and under the hairline for a secure fit. If you need to take your mask on and off repeatedly while wearing, I recommend the elastic cord. If you are going to be wearing your mask for a long period of time or would like to hang it on a wall, go with the satin ribbon.\r\n\r\nThis mask is from my new series called &quot;Mini Masquerade&quot;, in which I&#39;ve produced a set of more compact, stylized animals that are well suited for use as halloween costumes, masquerade masks, and as fun photo props at weddings.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nIf you are interested in a custom order for an item that I am not currently displaying in my store, send me a message and I can give you a quote. I&#39;ve enjoyed working with many customers doing custom pieces.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in multiple masks, ask me about the discount.\r\nIf you need shipping to a country that is not listed, message me.",

I will send you the tracking number after your package has shipped and you can track it online. I have a shipping upgrade available (Express Mail) which usually takes 1 day to arrive. This is also referred to as &quot;overnight shipping&quot;, however, some locations still take 2 days for Express Mail to deliver to.\r\n\r\nInternational Shipping:\r\nAlthough I typically only ship within the United States, I can sometimes make exceptions and ship internationally via First Class Mail. Message me if you need me to add your destination. In such cases, please understand that although I produce and ship your mask as quickly as I can (within 3-5 days of purchase) I cannot guarantee when your product will arrive because of possible customs delays and an inability to track the package. If you&#39;d like to upgrade to a trackable, faster international shipping option, message me and I will give you a quote on the additional Priority Mail shipping charge.\r\n\r\nAdditional Info:\r\nShipping and Handling charges are calculated from the cost of packaging and cost of shipping. I do my best to make sure your mask is securely packaged so that it will not get damaged in transit.",

Your option is to exchange the mask for a new one and we will discuss details.",

"description": "You will receive one digital print of ANY ONE DOG or CAT from the existing collection of Dogs of The World designs. This listing is for the 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; size.\r\n\r\nThe full Dogs of The World series can be seen at:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/doggiedrawings?section_id=7450251\r\n\r\n*July 26th, 2014 - New Breeds added!*\r\nPlease look at the photos.\r\n\r\nClick here for the 11&quot; x 14&quot; size print\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/204282867/11x14-choose-your-dog-breed-art-print?ref=shop_home_active_1\r\n\r\n*WHEN ORDERING, YOU HAVE THREE OPTIONS*\r\n1. Regular print $10 - this is the existing design & breed name\r\n2. Your Dog&#39;s Name $11 - existing design, with your dog&#39;s name (in place of breed name) No other changes.\r\n3. Name & Custom Colors $18 - This is a customized print. Please read on for details...\r\n\r\n*ORDERING A CUSTOMIZED PRINT*\r\nWhen submitting your order, send me a note with your choice of dog breed, and if you are ordering a customized version, include your dog&#39;s name and physical description.\r\n\r\nWhen you order a customized print of a dog or cat design, I use the original dog design from the series with the same background color as the print that the dog came from (eg, a PUG print will have the same green background as the Asian Dogs print) *UPDATE* Due to popular request, the URL &quot;doggiedrawings.net&quot; will no longer appear on the physical print from orders processed 9/29/2014 and onwards.\r\n\r\nHere are the simple changes that I can make to the original design at your written request:\r\n\r\n- coat and marking colors \r\n- ears and tails (length and type)\r\n- legs (shortening or lengthening)\r\n- hair (adding &#39;foof&#39; in some areas)\r\n- adding your dog&#39;s name or any text you want (same font and placement)\r\n- different background color (please choose a background color from this series only, eg &quot;blue background from Swiss Dogs print&quot;, or &quot;turquoise from Cats print&quot; etc)\r\n\r\nIf it is helpful to send me photos of your dog for reference, please do! You can do this through etsy private messaging or by email to lili.chin@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThe customization process does NOT include changing expressions or poses, adding additional items like clothing/objects, or having more than one dog in the image. \r\n\r\n*TURNAROUND TIME*\r\nThe customization process will take 1-7 days and I will send you a small preview image to approve before I print and ship.\r\n\r\n*PRINTING*\r\nI print on 60lb Premium Matte or Greenpix Matte paper. Every piece is individually printed by me on an Epson printer using archival pigment inks. \r\n\r\n*COLOR*\r\nPlease accept that the colors in the physical prints may vary slightly from what you see on your computer monitor.\r\n\r\n*DIGITAL FILES*\r\n I am not selling any high resolution digital files. The small web-resolution digital file that you receive to proof your customized print can be shared on social media.  And I thank you in advance for linking to this store or to my facebook page at www.facebook.com/doggiedrawings \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in commissioning a unique design or portrait of your dog to receive a digital file that you can reproduce for personal or commercial reasons, please visit my website www.doggiedrawings.net  and contact me with your needs. \r\n\r\n*SHIPPING*\r\nI ship smaller prints in a rigid Stayflat mailer and larger prints in a mailing tube. Domestic orders are shipped via USPS First Class Mail. If the total shipping fee for your order exceeds $5, I will ship USPS Priority Mail (2-3 days). International orders are shipped via USPS International First Class Mail. I will ship your packages to the address associated with your Etsy account so please make sure that this is correct. All shipments include tracking.\r\n\r\n*COPYRIGHTS*\r\nAll designs including customized designs are ©2014 Lili Chin",

"title": "YOU PICK COLOR Faux fur tail, handmade, keychain, bag charm, bright colors, fake fur, fox, wolf, cat, raccoon, coyote, etc",
"description": "Add a note to your order including the number and letter of which fur colors you would like.\r\n\r\nThese tails are made with wonderfully bright, soft, high quality, super plush and fluffy, long pile faux fur. They are flexible and swing and sway as you move like a real tail. And they are not made out of real fur so no animals were hurt! The tail attaches with both a keychain and lobster claw. This cute and wild tail will really bring out your inner animal. It is a great attention grabber for Halloween, parties, raving, festivals, Burning Man out on the Playa, EDC, Cosplay, clubbing, clubwear, cyber goth, cyberwear, the snow or everyday use. \r\n\r\nPrices for basic tails:\r\n\r\n- small: $18 (12 inches)\r\n- medium: $28 (18 inches)\r\n- large:$38 (24 inches)\r\n\r\n I can combine colors to makes stripes like a raccoon or red panda. Or a tail with a tip like a fox.\r\n\r\nPrices for tails with tips:\r\n\r\n- small: $22 (12 inches)\r\n- medium: $32 (18 inches)\r\n- large:$42 (24 inches)\r\n\r\nPrices for tails with stripes:\r\n\r\n- small: $25 (12 inches)\r\n- medium: $35 (18 inches)\r\n- large:$45 (24 inches)\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk about my &quot;natural&quot; colored furs for a more realistic looking tail.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to design a custom or character tail for you.\r\nTails can also be made to match any scoodie in my shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Each item is made to order and ships depending on fabric availability and the amount of orders I am processing. Please allow up to one to two week (usually less) after purchase before order ships.\r\nAllow a maximum of one business week for shipping and handling within the U.S. (more for international).\r\nAll of my creations are shipped with insurance and tracking included, in case anything should happen during the shipping process.\r\nIf you would prefer to have Express shipping message me and we can arrange that. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Machine wash cold. Hang dry (do not put in dryer as it will melt the fur and your tail will be ruined!!!)\r\nOnce dry you can shake the tail and/or lightly comb through the fur with a comb or brush to bring the original luster and fluffiness back.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also have a FaceBook Page where new designs, offers and other products are presented. Check us out! We&#39;d love to hear your feedback and see your photos of the things you&#39;ve received from MangosMadness being worn! \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MangosMadness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease take a minute to view my shop policies here: http://www.etsy.com/shop/MangosMadness/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav\r\n\r\nThank you very much for visiting my store.\r\nEnjoy and please leave feedback! &lt;3 ~Mango",

It is very shiny with some marks and a little wear (age 52 yrs.).  It  is 22 mm in diameter (US Quarter is 24.2mm) and has a great image of a Husky with the Date and Value.   The reverse shows a portrait of King Olav V, and can be faced forward if you like.  The finished drop is NOT reversible as the bonding pad will obscure the view of the back-facing side.  You may choose either side for the front.\r\n\r\nIf this is confusing, just send me an email, and I will help you figure it out.\r\n\r\nYou may choose the Item Only option, for 12.99 - Shipped in a padded envelope.  OR\r\nYou may order the Simple Drop Option, for 15.99, which includes a nice box for giving or storage.\r\n\r\nThen, just select the Item you want me to make for you.  All items are pictured in this listing.\r\n\r\nLADIES&#39; NECKLACE - comes with 2 Silver Plated Chains (20&quot; x 1.6mm Curb Chain and 24&quot; x 3mm Rope Chain) \r\n\r\nMONEY CLIP - is made of Stainless Steel and looks great with any coin.\r\n\r\nMAN DROP -is like the ladies&#39; necklace, but has a 24&quot; Silver Plated bead chain (like the dogtag chains).\r\n\r\nKEY RING is very sturdy, and holds the same drop as the necklaces.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about the quality of this product, check the Feedback from my previous customers (above).  \r\n\r\nI do NOT drill or otherwise damage coins because it detracts from their integrity and overall  appearance.  Also, drilling is unnecessary with modern adhesives, which are actually more reliable than most of the bails used in drilled coins.  \r\n\r\nValue Drops and Money Clips are shipped First Class USPS mail in a padded envelope, including a pretty little gift box (pictured).\r\n\r\nAll Custom Coin Jewelry merchandise is GUARANTEED to be shiny, sturdy, and lovable.  If you don&#39;t love your drop, I&#39;ll buy it back.  Same if it breaks or doesn&#39;t shine enough.",
